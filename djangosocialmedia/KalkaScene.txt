1. Make sure to understand signals, play around with it and understand how they are being implemented in this project. 

2. See how signals can be used to perform much more complicated tasks and play around with it.

3. Go through the functionality in the "users" app - this includes forms, views, urls and models.

4. Go through the class based view in the "blog" app.

5. Play around with these class based views for new models that you are able to create and see if can make them to what I need them to do - This is especially important 
    in consideration of what I intend on doing with this particular application as well as the inventory observation application. 

6. Other things that are part of this project. 

7. Plan the next steps of this project for me to turn it into what I want to turn this into.
